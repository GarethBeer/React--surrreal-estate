Surreal Estates.

This was for a task set out by Manchester Codes, the aim was to build a Real Estate website using the React library.

The app has three main pages:

Add Property Page - this page contains a form which allows a user to input information such as Location, Type, Price, Bedrooms,Bathrooms and a description of the Property. This information is then saved into a database.

Properties Page - this page gathers all properties saved in the database and displays them in the form of a property card. The cards show all the information relating to that property.

Favourites Page - this page is only accessible if a user logs in using their facebook account. Once logged in the user is able to save their favourite properties on the properties page and those saved properties are then rendered on the favourites page. The user is able to delete properties.

Pages are all routed using react-router and testing was done using Jest and Enzyme.
